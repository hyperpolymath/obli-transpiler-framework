# Complex example: password strength check
# Demonstrates nested operations and secrecy propagation

let user_input = secret(8)
let min_length = 6
let bonus = 10

# This comparison involves a secret, so it becomes ct_select
if user_input >= min_length
  then secret(100) + secret(bonus)
  else secret(0)
